# Canvas-google-shared-calender
A bit of software to help me merge my calendars, hopefully quite simple and easy to understand. 

2 things I hope you have noticed. The first one is that this site is totally empty, but their will be the begginings of the Google api calendar coming soon. The other thing is that I spelled calendar wrong in the title. it is "calendar", not "calender".
