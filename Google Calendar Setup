This is quite a boaring file, but to get up and running with the calendar api, visit their quick start guide at https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python, 
and since I'm not an experienced programmer, I was reading those pages constantly. They do a pretty good job of summarizing the API, although it is missing reminders
and other functions of Google Calendar, so I definately will take a deeper dive.
